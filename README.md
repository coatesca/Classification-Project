# Churn Classification Project

The data was analyzed using the following three models: SVM, logistic regression, and random forest. During the EDA process any unnecessary or repetitive variables were removed. Features for X were chosen based on stronger correlations with the target variable, Churn Value. GridSeachCV was used for cross validation on all models. In order to combat the imbalance in target classes, SMOTE was incorporated, though it made little difference to improve model accuracy scores. Instead, adding more variables for X, though intially disregarded during the EDA phase, were re-introduced. This greatly improved the models' accuracy, specifically the SVM model, by nearly %10. Before the re-introduction of additional X variables, the recall and precision for the underrepresented class (1) were much lower, compared to after where they are much more even with the overrepresented class (0). The final model, SVM, had the highest accuracy when tested on the same X variables for all the models. It predicted a customer was likely to churn when fitted on new data.
